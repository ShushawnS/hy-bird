# hy-bird.

üê§** What is it?**

‚ú® hy-bird. ‚ú® is a mobile app that eases the transition from working at home into the office. hy-bird. allows you to complete daily covid check-ins, book desks and meeting rooms, and more! Users are given a questionnaire to fill out to determine the best days for them to come into the office.

üßë‚Äçüíª **How we built it?**

At first, we had a quick brainstorming session of the main functionalities and features of our app. From there we split into 2 groups, design and development.

On the development side, we decided to create the application using android studio. Shushawn and Josh worked together to create a functional login and dashboard. Josh worked on integrating the OpenWeather API to display the 5-day forecast while Shushawn created an algorithm that assigns a score to each day ‚Äì higher score indicating better day to go to office. 

On the design side, we began by sketching and wireframing different flows of the app on Figma. We knew we wanted to implement dark mode, thus built a compatible design system including color, typography, and iconography.  Mehak worked on the login page, onboarding process, dashboard and calendar, while Anna worked on the desk/meeting room booking and search function.
